👋 Hi, I’m @Therenthe
👀 I’m interested in software testing, automation, and learning new programming languages.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python and exploring ways to improve my skills in test automation.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly Python projects and any testing-related open-source projects.
